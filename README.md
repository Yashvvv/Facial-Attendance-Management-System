# Facial-Attendance-Management-System
A facial attendance recognition-based system is an automated solution that uses facial recognition technology to mark attendance. The system first captures the user's facial data through a camera, processing it to identify unique facial features. This data is then compared with a pre-registered database of users to verify their identity. Once the user's identity is confirmed, the system records their attendance and links it directly to an Excel sheet or a centralized database. This approach not only ensures accurate and real-time attendance tracking but also eliminates the need for manual data entry, reducing errors and streamlining administrative tasks. The system can be used in various settings, such as educational institutions, workplaces, and events, enhancing security and efficiency.
